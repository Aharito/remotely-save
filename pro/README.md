## Smart Conflict

Basic (free) version can detect conflicts, but users have to choose to keep newer version or larger version of the files.

PRO (paid) feature "Smart Conflict" gives users one more option: merge small markdown files, or duplicate large markdown files or non-markdown files.

## License

The codes or files or subfolders inside the current folder (`pro` in the repo), are released under "source available" license: "PolyForm Strict License 1.0.0".

Suggestions are welcome.
