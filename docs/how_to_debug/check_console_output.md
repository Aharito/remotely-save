# Check Console Output

If you are using Obsidian on desktop, you can check the Obsidian console.

## Disable Auto Sync Firstly

You should disable auto sync to avoid any unexpected running.

## Set The Output Level To Debug

Go to the plugin settings, scroll down to the section "Debug" -> "alter console log level", and change it from "info" to "debug".

## Check The Output

Then, press the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+shift+i" if you are on Windows or Linux, or press "cmd+shift+i" if you are on macOS. You should be able to see the console of Obsidian.

Trigger the sync manually (by clicking the icon on the ribbon sidebar). Something (hopefully) helpful should show up in the console. You could understand what happened and what goes wrong more explictly by checking the output.
